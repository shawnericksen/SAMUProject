# What is SAMUProject?
SAMUProject or Smart AniList Media Update Project is a tool for generating submissions for AniList data.

## Purpose
SAMUProject's initial goal is to build a proof of concept that integrates a Large Language Model (LLM) with web search and generates submissions for data to AniList.

The proof of concept will focus on information about characters, such as age, gender, and descriptions. After the proof of concept stage, the aim will be to expand the scope.

## Ethics
SAMUProject aims to smartly fill in gaps in the AniList media database. As this project develops, I am following a set of guidelines:

**1. Autonomy with Oversight:**  
SAMUBot operates autonomously, scraping data and generating submissions. However, every piece of information it gathers comes with citations, ensuring moderators can validate its findings and maintain the quality and relevance of the data.

**2. Respect for the Data:**  
Accuracy and respect are paramount. SAMUBot is designed to ensure there's no infringement on copyrights or misuse of information.

**3. Continuous Improvement:**  
This project, like any other, is a work in progress. Feedback is invaluable, and suggestions are always welcome to improve the project's efficacy.

**4. Open Dialogue:**  
If you have questions about SAMUProject, or if you're just curious, feel free to reach out to the project email at [samuproject.dev@gmail.com](mailto:samuproject.dev@gmail.com) or my email at [shawnericksen.github@protonmail.com](mailto:shawnericksen.github@protonmail.com).

SAMUProject is a solo endeavor, but ultimately was created to benefit the AniList community. This commitment is to ensure it serves the community responsibly and effectively.
